Lee *thinks* a regular n-sided (convex) polygon is beautiful **if and only if** he can rotate it in such a way that **at least** one of its edges is parallel to the OX-axis and at least one of its edges is parallel to the OY-axis at the same time.<br/>
Recall that a regular n-sided polygon is a convex polygon with n vertices such that all the edges and angles are equal.<br/>
Now he is shopping: the market has t regular polygons. For each of them print YES if it is beautiful and NO otherwise.<br/>

**Input** : The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of polygons in the market.<br/>
**Output** : For each polygon, print YES if it's beautiful or NO otherwise (case insensitive).
